# 👋 Hi there, I'm Aditya Sakhale

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a graduate student at NYU, studying Management and Business Analytics. 
My journey into data science began with a simple question: *"How can we use data to make smarter, faster decisions?"* 
Since then, I’ve been building projects that explore machine learning, data visualization, and storytelling with numbers.

Whether it’s analyzing customer behavior, forecasting business trends, or building dashboards that bring insights to life, 
I enjoy solving real-world problems with data.
